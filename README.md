# Getting Started 

• Built a T-Shirt-based E-Commerce Web application using mentioned
  technologies that allow users to choose what they want to buy quickly.
• Used Redux for user authentication and efficient state management.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## starting the project 

### In the project directory run the following commands in the 3 split terminals to start the ReactApp.

### "npm run build"
* Start "npm run build" to run React "build" folder in one terminal.
### "nodemon server"

* Run "nodemon server" to start the web server and to make sure the Database connection is in another terminal.

### "json-server --watch db.json --port 8000" 
* Run "json-server --watch db.json --port 8000", so that the local db.json file gets started in the 3rd terminal.

### "http://localhost:9002" 
* Finally open "http://localhost:9002" in the browser to run the React app.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# React app :

* The loading page of the Project consists of 3 pages which include the "WELCOME", "ABOUT PAGE", and "Log in" pages.
* log in to see the project's Detailed view 

## signup and login 
* Click on a new user to register, and register with the proper username and password.
* You will be directed to the login page after successful signup. 

## T-shirt 
* on the successful running of all 3 commands you shall see an interface of the T-shirt buying eCommerce application which includes a vast variety.

## Cart 
* Products are added to the cart, and the price is reflected accordingly.
* The Redux part of the Project makes an efficient State management i.e on changing any values of the product in the database, which also gets reflected in the products which are added to the cart.
* An invoice is also generated at last.

## Reducers 
* I used 2 reducers in this project which include the user reducer and a Cart Reducer.

## MongoDB
* The user's data from the signup page are stored here.

## Design and Styling
* used Bootstrap, CSS, and React-Bootstrap For better UI.
